## YouChoose
YouChoose allows anonymous proof of account ownership (PAO) for email identities. Using a PAO, a prover proves ownership of an email address but in conventional methods the prover ends up revealing their full email address to the verifier. For example, OTP based challenges &ndash; prover enters their email address on the verifier's website and recieves a challenge on that email address from the verifier. To prove ownership, the prover retrieves the challenge and submits it to the verifier.

YouChoose allows the prover to prove ownership of their email address without revealing their full email address to the verifier. It is based on SCI first introduced by Wang et al. in [1].
